# Cognex Data File Converter - .txt to .csv 
This program was writen for a client who was saving data from multiple Cognex Vision System Cameras to a notepad .txt file. The Cognex data would be sent to these files for each individual vision system which would generate multiple text files.

This problem with the data is it is very difficult to analyse from notepad and is very messy and cluttered. This program serves as a simple desktop application allowing the client to convert their data from the notepad into a sorted CSV file where they can then create graphs and analyse the data much easier. This saves a huge amount of time for the client as this was always a bottleneck in the data analysis process.
